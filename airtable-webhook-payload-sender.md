# üì§ Send Airtable Record as Webhook Payload

## Description
This Airtable Automation script sends a POST request to a specified webhook URL with selected record field values as a JSON payload.

## Instructions

1. **Create an Airtable Automation**  
   - Trigger: Choose a trigger (e.g., "When record is created" or "When record is updated").
   - Action: Add a "Run a script" step.

2. **Configure Input Variables**  
   In the "Run a script" action, add input variables:
   - `webhookUrl`: The target endpoint where the payload will be sent.
   - Any other variables you want to include in the payload (e.g., `name`, `email`, `recordId`, etc.).

3. **Paste the Script Below**

Use the following script in the script editor:

```javascript
const config = input.config();

// Safely extract webhookUrl and remove it from payload
const webhookUrl = config["webhookUrl"];
const payload = Object.assign({}, config);
delete payload["webhookUrl"];

if (!webhookUrl) {
    throw new Error("‚ùå Error: webhookUrl is required");
}

try {
    const response = await fetch(webhookUrl, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    });

    console.log(`‚úÖ Success: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
    const responseText = await response.text();
    console.log(`üîÅ Response body: ${responseText}`);
} catch (error) {
    console.error(`‚ùå Failed to send webhook: ${error.message}`);
    throw error;
}

   ```

4. **Test the Automation**  
   Make sure to run a test with a valid webhook URL to confirm that data is being delivered correctly.

## ‚úÖ Tips & Requirements
- The `webhookUrl` field is required and must be a valid POST endpoint.
- All other input variables will be included in the POST body as a JSON object.
- The receiving service must be ready to accept and parse a `Content-Type: application/json` payload.
- Great for use with Make.com custom webhooks, serverless functions, or internal APIs.
