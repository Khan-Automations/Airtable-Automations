## 🚀 About This Repository

This is not just a script dump.

Each script in this repository is:

✅ **Modular** — designed to solve a specific problem  
✅ **Reusable** — easy to adapt to other use cases  
✅ **Documented** — each script has its own `.md` file with inputs, logic, and sample output  
✅ **Production-tested** — used in actual client workflows  

If you’re building with **Airtable, Webflow, Make, Notion, or external APIs** — you’ll find a script here that can save you hours.
